------------The CrepeOS User Manual for CrepeOS 10.0------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to CrepeOS! This manual will guide you through everything you
need to know about this OS.

- Get Started
CrepeOS is programmed in x86 Assembly. Therefore, you must compile it
from source. Sounds a bit scary, right? Not as bad as you may think.
First, some requirements:
- You MUST be on a Linux system. This WILL NOT work on Windows, and 
very rarely works on macOS.
Go into your Linux terminal, and cd into the crepeos folder, where
there are two items, a folder called Sources and a file called make.sh.
Run this command: sudo ./make.sh
This will do all the work for you. If nasm is not installed, it will 
automatically install it for you. This will take a minute, but once
it is installed, the make.sh will take only a few seconds.
Use a tool to create a bootable USB. The recommended way to do this
is to copy the newly created ISO in Sources/IMAGES to a Windows 
computer, and use Rufus to make the bootable USB. (You can find Rufus
at this website: https://rufus.ie)
***PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. MAKE SURE TO SET THE BOOT MODE TO BIOS/
UEFI-CSM. DO NOT SET IT TO UEFI AS IT MAY CORRUPT DATA ON YOUR HARD
DRIVE!!!***
After that is done, restart your computer. Boot from the USB device.
You should have a working bootable install of CrepeOS!

This manual is unfinished, as this is developer beta 1. More updates soon!
