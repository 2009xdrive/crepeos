Some programs are broken
Calculator paifully slow

==================== BETA 1.2 CHANGE LOG BY 2009xdrive ====================
- Reworked the system file structure
- ASMCODE has been reworked to the program folder, as it has .asm
autodetect
- Shortened the CREPEOS_LIVE:~$ to CREPEOS:~$
Removed the "64bit" marking and replaced it with the version number + b1 
to indicate OS Beta 1
- Made this change log appear in the file system
- OSStart.sh now starts QEMU when finished building, and backs up the 
old disk images for data preservation. You can revert to the previous
saved image ushing the script in OS/recovery.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Notes:
- Calculator is written in CrBASIC, which is a form of BASIC, which
explains why it is slow. I will include a .BIN version of the
calculator, which should run worlds faster.
- CrepeOS is run in 16bit "real mode", which is why I removed the "64bit"
marking. 
- Some programs are broken, because they are meant to be run from EDIT.BIN.
The .BAS programs, open them in the editor, and press F8 to run them in the
inbuilt BASIC interpreter. Or, run them from the CLI to see if they give an
error, or require arguments.
- I tried on the real-time clock, and failed sadly. Note that there already
is a DATE and TIME command that returns the date and time respectively in 
the command line already. For now, the top bar is the currently running 
application name.
