v0.6b1 change log (via GitHub):
Bug fixes. (obviously)
Added Mac build script. This allows Mac users to be able 
to build CrepeOS.
New naming scheme. (IMPORTANT) Releases from here on out 
will be numbered as follows:
"v0.6" (the feature update version, if this changes that 
indicates a major update somewhere.)
"b1" (the beta update number. When released and a separate 
beta update channel is created, will increment until the 
final update release. Such as: v1.1, v1.2b1, v1.2b2, continuing 
for however many betas there are, v1.2 final release. During 
prerelease, or versions that begin with 0 such as v0.6, 
there is no "final release", there will only be betas. 
Don't expect a "v0.6" without a beta tag.)
Working on implementing a new text editor called VEdit. 
Warning that it is broken as of this release and should be fixed 
by v0.7b1.
New debug tool MONITEST. This is self-explanatory and tests your screen.
New BASIC programs.

v0.6b2 change log:
Fixed files not being added to the boot disk.
Fixed the Mac build script.
