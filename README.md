# CrepeOS

## About
CrepeOS is an Operating System based on MikeOS. It is an OS designed to be
different, while remaining fast and light. 
CrepeOS comes with some default apps,
a BASIC Interpreter and a BASIC Library.
There are games built in such as Cosmic Flight, 
2048, and Hangman. It has a built-in file explorer
and text editor.
